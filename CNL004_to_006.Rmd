## Check each assessment for data quality

```{r}
view(dfSummary(exposureData))
view(dfSummary(seqcmplData))
view(dfSummary(omotData))
summary(exposureData$rt)
```

**Does RT go down or up as the task goes on?**

```{r}
plot(exposureData$TrialNumber, exposureData$rt, main="Sample Kid")
cor.test(exposureData$TrialNumber, exposureData$rt)
```
It goes down (not surprisingly)!

**Is RT longer after transition nodes?**
```{r}
exposureData$transition_node <- ifelse((exposureData$node1==4 & exposureData$node2 ==5) |(exposureData$node1 ==5 & exposureData$node2 ==4), 1, 0)
exposureData$transition_node <- factor(exposureData$transition_node, labels=c("No", "Yes"))
exposureData %>%  group_by(transition_node) %>% summarise(avg_rt=mean(rt), med_rt=median(rt), std_dev=sd(rt), n_trials=n())
```
Yes.

**How long does it take with 150 nodes (of which 4 are practice trials)?**
```{r}
max(exposureData$onset)/60
```
## Sequence Completion Task

How many are correct? 75%.
```{r}
table(seqcmplData$correct)
```

## Odd Man Out Task-Did not do
```{r}
view(dfSummary(omotData))
```
On average, 60% correct on OMOT.

Does average number correct differ by trial type?
```{r}
omotData %>% group_by(trial_type) %>% summarise(avg_correct=mean(correct))
```
The 'correct' answer for catch trials is the node that is 2 edges away rather than one edge away. 72% is still above chance on the conservative trials!

**Does RT differ by trial type?**
```{r}
omotData %>% group_by(trial_type) %>% summarise(avg_rt=mean(rt), med_rt=median(rt), std_dev=sd(rt), n_trials=n())
```
Average RT is highest in catch trials, lowest in conservative trials, as we would expect. Median RT is highest in non-conservative trials and lowest in conservative trials, again as we would expect.

**Does RT differ by sequence-longer later in the sequence, or shorter?**
```{r}
cor.test(omotData$TrialNumber, omotData$rt)
```

## Conclusions

Did better than expected--100% accuracy on OMOT conservative and catch trials, 75% accuracy on sequence completion and 72% on non-conservative OMOT trials.
RT on OMOT looks as we might expect, lowest for conservative trials, higher on non-conservative or catch trials.
Took 27 min with 300 nodes.
RT is not shorter on transition node (4 to 5)

#omotData$correct <- factor(omotData$correct, ordered=TRUE, labels=c("Incorrect", "Correct")) #commented out because if make them factors then can't do proportion calculations on them.
```

## Check exposure data quality

exposureData %>%  group_by(transition_node) %>% summarise(avg_rt=mean(rt), med_rt=median(rt), std_dev=sd(rt), n_trials=n())

Yes, it is!

**How long does it take with 200 nodes?**

## Sequence Completion Task

```{r}

## Odd Man Out Task

```
On average, 58% correct on OMOT.

Does average number correct differ by trial type?
```{r}
omotData %>% group_by(trial_type) %>% summarise(avg_correct=mean(correct))
```
The 'correct' answer for catch trials is the node that is 2 edges away rather than one edge away, but they are within the same community. 44% is still above chance on the non-conservative trials!

**Does RT differ by trial type?**
```{r}
omotData %>% group_by(trial_type) %>% summarise(avg_rt=mean(rt), med_rt=median(rt), std_dev=sd(rt), n_trials=n())
```
Average and median RT is highest in non-conservative trials, lowest in conservative trials, as we would expect.

**Does RT differ by sequence-longer later in the sequence, or shorter?**
```{r}
cor.test(omotData$TrialNumber, omotData$rt)
```
Not strongly so.

## Conclusions

Did better than expected on sequence completion--100% accuracy on sequence completion. 
75% accuracy on OMOT catch trials, 61% on conservative trials and 44% on non-conservative trials (still above chance at 33%),
RT on OMOT looks as we might expect, lowest for conservative trials, highest on non-conservative trials.
Took 13 min with 200 nodes. Should I make it shorter, still?
RT is longer on transition nodes (4 to 5 or 5 to 4).

100% correct on OMOT!

NO difference.

**Does RT differ by trial type?**

Not strongly so.

## Conclusions

Did better than expected! 88% accuracy on sequence completion and 100% accuracy on the OMOT.
RT on OMOT looks as we might expect, lowest for conservative trials, highest on catch trials.
Took 17 min with 200 nodes. Not enough variance?
RT is not longer on transition nodes (4 to 5 or 5 to 4).
